# Swiggy-Data-Analysis

In this project, I analyzed Swiggyâ€™s order and delivery performance using Power BI to derive actionable insights. The dataset was prepared by cleaning and organizing the data, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency for analysis. I built interactive dashboards to provide real-time insights into delivery patterns, customer satisfaction, and restaurant performance. Visualizations were used to track key metrics,helping to streamline operations and optimize partnerships.
